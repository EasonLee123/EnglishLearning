# Environment Topic

## Task1: Style Questions  
1. Are there any environmental problems in your country?</br>
	Absolutely yes. the most common environmental issue in my city/hometown/country is (that) exhausted emissions produced by cars and motorbikes have been afflicting the air and water quality. My government is struggling to deal with the problem.  
	
2. Do you take an interest in nature?</br>
	Of course yes, As a city person, I barely have an opportunity to experience the natural environement. So whenever I get a holiday/vacation, I really prefer to go to the far-off destination, which make me get closer to the nature and discover the beauty of the natural world.  
	
3. Do you or your family take steps to help the environment?</br>
	Yes we do. We always turn off lights or other electronic appliances when they are unnecessary. Also, we will pay attention on closing off the faucet/water-tap timely. Although this is minor action, I believe that it could make significantly contribution to the environment.

## Task2  

Describe environmental pollution in your city.
- what type of pollution is/are?
- why it had happened?
- explain how this pollution can be controlled  

I have been living in Guangzhou for almost 20 years, I have the chance to see/feel how the city has changed in these years. Due to the increasing of population and tourist, local enviorment has been polluted significantly. Indeed, many people will throw illegally rubbish into the land and water, which causes the land and water pollution. In addition, industrial waste from factories is contributing to the high level of pollution at the mean time.In order to control the issues, I would suggest every citizen in our city behave well in terms of pollution control. what's more, the government should heavily fine who are caught realising trash into the atmosphere. By carrying out the rule, people being intent to litter the environment will be afraid of being punished, which can deter them from discharging unlawful waste. Although two actions above is just simple. I think it will be an effective way to mitigate the environmental contamination in a long-term.
	
## Task3  

1. What do u think is the main danger the world face in term of environment?  
What hits my mind firstly is global warming, which causes natural disasters such drought or flash flood. the problem maninly stems from enhanced greenhouse effect in recent years. I believe that several steps should be taken to deal with the issue.  

2. What example are there of how we damage the natural world?  
There are factories that realease toxic waste directly into the air and water, which causes air and water pollution. As a result, many people are diagnosed with health problems such as lung or throat cancer. In addition, a large number of land and rain forests are destroyed to make way for agriculture field.  

3. In which ways do we respond well to environmental problems?  
Well, on the one hand more and more pople are aware of the seriousness of environmental issue, and they start to take some actions such as saving water from daily life or conserving energy by taking public transport.on the other hand some envionmental groups/agencies are always the first on the scene with humanitarian aid after natural and man-made disasters, and they are constantly raising awareness of issues and trying to stop disasters happening.
