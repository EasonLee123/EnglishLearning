## "The next pandemic": drought is a hidden global crisis, UN says  

Drought is a hidden global crisis that risks becoming "the next pandemic" if countries do not take urgent action on water and land management and tackling the climate emergency，the UN has said.

Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary general's special representative for disaster risk reduction, said: "Drought is on the verge of becoming the next pandemic and there is no vaccine to cure it.Most of the world will be living with water stress in the next few years.Demand will outstrip supply during certain periods.Drought is a major factor in land degradation and the decline of yields for major crops."  

She said many people had an image of drought as affecting desert regions in Africa, but that this was not the case.Developed countries have not been immune.The US, Australia ansouthern Europe have experienced drought in recent years.

Drought also goes beyond agriculture, said Roger Pulwarty, a co-author of Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction: Special Report on Drought 2021.He pointed to the Danube in Europe, where recurring drought in recent years has affected transport, tourism, industry and energy generation.

Changing rainfall patterns as a result of climate breakdown are a key driver of drought, but the report also identifies the inefficient use of water resources and the degradation of land under intensive agriculture and poor farming practices as playing a role.

Mizutori called for governments to take action to help prevent drought by reforming and regulating how water is extracted, stored and used, and how land is managed.
